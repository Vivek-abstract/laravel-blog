Beautiful code

Why do we code?
Often in our fast paced technological career, we forget our why? Why do we, software engineers code?
The answer is simple: to solve problems.

As with most problems, we may not know how to solve them on our own - so we seek help.
Most of our projects would require some amount of collaboration with other engineers.

The ability of a software engineer to write readable and understandable code defines how good of an engineer
he/she is.
